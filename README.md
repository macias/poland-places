# Poland — places

Useful maps for your bikepacking trips (in Poland) — see it at [Google Maps](https://www.google.com/maps/d/edit?mid=1l2Pl5J3VAosJ-ESXrLPnW0w6s7h-yeNe&usp=sharing).
See my PL/EN [blog](https://przypadkopis.wordpress.com/) for other, various in nature, resources.

## Romanesque trail

Based on [Szlak romański](https://turystyczneszlaki.pl/szlak-romanski/) with corrections using Google satellite maps and
[Polish wikipedia](https://pl.wikipedia.org/wiki/Szlak_Roma%C5%84ski_w_Polsce). There are still few places which I was unable to pinpoint (marked with “?”) and one
place which is probably an error (romanesque signpost in Stare Miasto; actually the artifact is located in Konin).

Please note some of the remainings are already gone.
